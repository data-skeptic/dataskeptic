<h1>The Ghost in the MP3 with Ryan Maguire</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered what is lost when you compress a song into an MP3?  This week's guest Ryan Maguire
did more than that.  He worked on software to issolate the sounds that are lost when you convert a lossless
digital audio recording into a compressed MP3 file.</p>

<p>To complete his project, Ryan worked primarily in python using the 
<a href="http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/">pyo</a> library as well as the 
<a href="https://github.com/bregmanstudio/BregmanToolkit">Bregman Toolkit</a></p>

<p>Ryan mentioned humans having a dynamic range of hearing from
