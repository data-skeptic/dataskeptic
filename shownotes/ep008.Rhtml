<h1>Streetlight Outage and Crime Rate Analysis with Zach Seeskin</h1>


<p>This episode features a discussion with statistics PhD student Zach Seeskin about a project he was 
involved in as part of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship.  The project involved 
exploring the relationship (if any) between streetlight outages and crime in the City of Chicago.  We discuss how the 
data was accessed via the City of Chicago data portal, how the analysis was done, and what correlations were discovered 
in the data.</p>
