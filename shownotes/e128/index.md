*NAVIGATION*

[Act 1](#act1) - This act introduces our central question for the episode.  It should be the most theatrical act.  We begin with a cold open of the question, acted out.  We conclude by letting Kyle speak indulgently about meta commentary about the show.

[Act 2](#act2) - As act 2 begins, we’re strictly down to business for the rest of the show.  The overall musical themes should demonstrate that by going from whimsical to serious.  We cover specific claims/devices include the Antikythera Mechanism, the Palimpsest of Archemedes, the Baghdad Battery, and generally "ancient aliens" claims.

[Act 3](#act3) - In Act 3, the narrative centers on persistence.  What are the oldest artifacts we have?  What modern artifacts are likely to survive far into the future?  What do we most want to preserve for the future, and how can we accomplish it?

## ACT 1

### ASKER

The question is: "How far?"

BEGIN MUSIC - mostly reed instruments, drums, and bass

### NARRATOR
Imagine yourself being suddenly transported back in time.  Its 2000 BCE.  You're in the Mayan civilization, living in a Maya body, speaking the Maya language, but you've got all the memories of modern person.  You're transported back in time.

### NARRATOR
No electricity.  No motorized vehicles.  No computers.  No internet.  Perhaps banking and postal systems, albeit simple ones, exist.

SOUND EFFECTS - timed to match electricity, vehicles, computers, internet

### NARRATOR
What can you do to move the civilization forward towards a recovery of all modern knowledge?  How much could one person accomplish in a lifetime?  How would their impact propgate two generations down the line?

### NARRATOR
How quickly could things move from this...

SOUND EFFECTS - sound of nature, tree chopping, and an arrow being shot

### NARRATOR
to this...?

SOUND EFFECTS - sound of a NYC street with construction from visit during Steve’s wedding

### NARRATOR
How many decades before the first automobile could be manufactured?  How many countless breakthroughs are required to be repeated, many of them necessarily in a particular order.

### NARRATOR
Breakthroughs in metal and plastic.  Breakthroughs in refinement and elastic.

### NARRATOR
Picture yourself also having access to essentially unlimited money.  You hire a team of the brightest Mayans.  You can access the best resources available.  Assume you experience no societal resistance, and take for granted a culture willing to migrate immediately to what is faster, more efficient, or in some other way better.

### NARRATOR
All available resources are at your disposal.  Oh, and you've got a copy of Wikipedia.

[dramatic change in music]

### NARRATOR
Now build a car.

SOUND EFFECT: Car rev noise

### NARRATOR
Do whatever it takes, but build a car.

SOUND EFFECT: Car revs louder

### NARRATOR
Debate in your mind the steps required to launch the petrolieum industry.  Inspect the most advanced forges as they smelt gold, copper, and silver.  Teach them how to work lead, bronze, and tin such that they might master iron in time for you to explain the steam engine.

### NARRATOR
Independently, invent the [___spritz injector____] and tell them they need to get good at manufacturing mechanisms that perform this opperation.

[Logging sounds begin here]

### NARRATOR
Find rubber trees.  Start farms.  Estimate the rate of progress on wheel development and plan enough trees so that the required amount of rubber can be manufactured years later when the trees are large enough to meet the forecasted demand.

TODO: brakes, transmission

TODO: By now, would should have shown them gears, hope someone else understand [an important gear innovation]

TODO: electronics - gauss

TODO: advance medical to give yourself extra time

TODO: [[ First start of the car, compare to riding a model-t ]]

### NARRATOR
How long would that realistically take?

[Dramatic music change]

### KYLE
Next conceit.

### NARRATOR
You develop a reputation as a firehose of knowledge and an inner circle of carefully selected rotating apprentices follow you for a time, absorbing knowledge then starting industries.  Assume a people with a voracious appetite for innovation and technology, and imagine mastering the art of teaching to meet the demand and velocity with which your apprentices are capable of absorbing knowledge.

### NARRATOR
Until one day, when this budding civilization... 

[Disaster sound effects]

### NARRATOR
is destroyed.  Obliterated.

[Music and sound effects halt abruptly]

### CHOIR
Erased.

### NARRATOR
It would seem the more advanced they've gotten, the higher the probability that evidence remains.  Bamboo huts decay in the blink of an eye.  Stone, depending on the masonry and climate, lasts longer, but are no friend of water or the entropy of nature.

### NARRATOR
Steel.  [[ more on steel ]].  That is, if you can make steel.

### NARRATOR
The higher a society has travelled technologically, the longer it's shadow persists.

### ASKER
The question is, "how far?"

### NARRATOR
How far along could an older human civilization have come, yet leave no fingerprint?  Likelihood decreases with time and with claim.  Either your lost civilization had not achieved sufficiently advanced technology to leave a record, or your lost civilization is incredibly old such that time has had the opportunity to erase.  But the older a society we consider, the more primitive a starting point they've come from.

[Sound of a tape reel running at high speed backwards]

### NARRATOR
Thinking on the scale of eons, one eventually looks up to see a limit on how far back we allow our fantasy to begin.  Homo sapiens began only 200,000 years ago.  This might not be the optimal point for our hypothetical insertion point, but it's as far back as one can consider.

### NARRATOR
So consider, a society of limited length on the fastest possible course of technological development with the benefit of modern knowledge.  It thrives, until suddenly, everyone dies.

[Sound of impact, fire, and diaster with a slow transition into the sound of the beach.  Muffled voices of people talking fades slower until they too are gone, leaving only the ocean sound]

### NARRATOR
A forgotten society, where every bit of record has been erased.  We can be absolutely certain that forgotten societies did indeed existed.  But what could their most impressive accomplishment have been?

### KYLE
This episode explores this question.  Under the most generous of conceits, what is the most extreme version of a claim of secret lost ancient wisdom that could plausibly be true?

[music feel change]

### KYLE
I recently asked a friend to review the 64th episode of Data Skeptic in which I attempt to calculate the probability, however small, that bigfoot just might be real.  She listened to a few other episodes as well.  One of the comments she made was to stop apologizing.  I guess when I do atypical episodes, I have a tendency to over-explain myself and to justify why its okay for the show to deviate from it’s normal format.

You are Data Skeptic, she told me.  Whatever you do, that’s it, so don’t apologize for it like you represent some governing body.  So I’m not going to justify why a data scientist who enjoys this show, or a skeptic who listens, should indulge me in this investigation.  If you get Data Skeptic, you’ll understand.  The same way if you get Data Skeptic, you’ll know why I start talking about measurements and long term storage.  I’m no longer going to justify what might seem like a tangent from our regularly scheduled program.  I guess I don’t anyone that, you’re welcome to your opinions.  But maybe there’s just one opinion I want to check in on.

TODO: transcribe the conversation I had with Linhda where she gives feedback on whether or not this is a good topic.

[MUSIC QUEUE MARKING END OF FIRST ACT]

## ACT 2


### KYLE
Let's frame the question this way.  I doubt there's any remote possibility an ancient civilization developed smartphones and all the technologies that necessarily came before it, and have that disappear entirely from our planet memory and our species' cultural memory.

But we also look at ancient civilizations with modern eyes.  One might think of them as primitive and incapable.  There's no reason to believe a human from a few thousand years ago was any less capable than modern people.  Physiologically, we're not very distant.  Our brains are the same size, and a structural match, containing no mutually exclusive elements.  We just have advantages they didn't yet.  Not only did I have elementary school, high school, and college available to me, so did most every other member of the workforce, the people I collaborate with.  Or at least, in my country, those opportunities were available.

New technology replaces old technology.  Things have been moving fast in recent decades.  There are consultants that specialize in older software and languages which have been discontinued for a decade or more.  Few people knowing such things and no incentive to learn them makes such a consultant occasionally very in demand at large companies that change slowly.  The number of remaining working Cobol engineers has got to be zero by now.  In a centuries time, no one will even know that language.

Technology doesn't always move seamlessly from version one, then two, then three, and so on.  Sometimes technology is wholly replaced by something completely different.

[EXAMPLE IN SKIT]

### KYLE
When something get's cheap enough, the optimal strategy's utility curve intersects the presently dominating solution.  If I had need to cut a stone, I'd use a very strong circular saw.  Why?  Because I know it will work and can aquire and power the tools.  Techniques used 3000 years ago were not so efficient.  They worked, but they worked much slower and with less precision.

Antikythera Mechanism

What formula / math is it using?

When do we find people doing that kind of math?

Engineering feat or math feat also?

*PALIMPSEST OF ARCHEMEDES*

### GUEST

TODO: First statements

### KYLE

TODO:

TODO: How far back did this set us mathematically?  How many years / centuries back?  How much sooner would we have had automobiles?

GUEST: 

### KYLE
I’ve heard many people speculate about Archemedes having either created or at least been a major contributor to creating the Antikythera Mechanism.  The geography is about right, and the time period is close enough, but it’s still always seemed like a stretch to me.  I wonder if it’s a bit like a human a few thousand years from now finding an old photograph and assuming Ansel Adams had taken it.  So two questions...

### KYLE
Do you think Archimedes could possibly have been involved in creating the Antikythera Mechanism?  Do you think there were other great thinkers of the time whose names we’ve forgotten that equally well could have been the device’s creator?

### GUEST
[To come]

*ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM*

SOUND EFFECT: A ship at sea and a storm beginning.

### KYLE
Best estimates, we’re between the years 80 and 50 BCE.  A Roman merchant ship is traveling west on a trade route in the Mediterranean.  The ship’s carrying a variety of goods, perhaps even overloaded with goods.  I don’t actually know if it was raining or anything.

SOUND EFFECT: loud lightning strike

### KYLE
I mean, it could have been.  The lightning just sounded really cool, so I put it in.  Whatever the cause, this ship ends up on the bottom of the sea and sits there until 1900 AD when a number of relics are recovered including a small badly decomposing bronze device of some sort.




*BAGHDAD BATTERY*

### GUEST
[first statements]

### KYLE
Wilhelm Konig was a painter by trade, and eventually held the position of director at the National Museum of Iraq.  There he had access to artifacts, one of which was a clay jar.  He published a report in 1940 which I was unable to locate, but secondary sources report it speculates this device may have been a Glavanic cell used for electroplating gold onto silver objects.

There's some debate about when the pot was created.  Let's assume either the earliest date of 250 BCE or the latest of 650 AD, depending on which date is most generous for the question we're asking.

### GUEST
[Explain electroplating]

### KYLE
Can you speculate on the earliest known time humans used electroplating?

### GUEST
[response]

### KYLE
What are the absolute bare bones prerequisite technologies or knowledge required for someone to perform electroplating?

### GUEST
[response]

### KYLE
How much amperage could be produced by the best electrical engineer if they had only the finest tools from 650 AD available to them?

### GUEST
[response]

### KYLE
I've got one closing question, but it's one that I may need your help formulating in a meaningful way, because I thin k we're going to get to the point of needing to quibble about definitions.  But here's my attempt...

When is it generally accepted that some human created the first battery, however primative, which successfully chemically captured energy that could later be extracted in the form of a potential different across two electric terminals?
