<h1>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve</h1>

<p>An ROC curve is a plot that compares the trade off of true positives and false positives of a binary classifier under different
thresholds.  The area under the curve (AUC) is useful in determining how discriminating a model is.  Together, ROC and AUC are
very useful diagnostics for understanding the power of one's model and how to tune it.</p>
