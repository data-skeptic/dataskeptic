<h1>Using Data to Help Those in Crisis</h1>

<p>This week Noelle Sio Saldana discusses her volunteer work at Crisis Text Line - a 24/7 service that connects anyone with crisis counselors.
In the episode we discuss Noelle's career and how, as a participant in the Pivotal for Good program (a partnership with DataKind), she spent
three months helping find insights in the messaging data collected by Crisis Text Line.  These insights helped give visibility into a number
of different aspects of Crisis Text Line's services.  Listen to this episode to find out how!</p>

<p>You can read Noelle's blog post on this topic on the 
<a href="https://blog.pivotal.io/?p=12066">Pivotal POV blog</a>, and you can see some of the data discussed in this episode at 
<a href="http://www.crisistrends.org/">crisistrends.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you or someone you know is in a moment of crisis, there's someone ready to talk to you by texting the shortcode 741741.</p>
