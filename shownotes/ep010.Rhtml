and <a href="http://www.hitsphere.com/">HitSphere - the Healthcare IT Supersite</a>.</p>

<p>During the program, Kyle recommended a talk from the 
<a href="http://www.mitcio.com/">2014 MIT Sloan CIO Symposium</a>

<p>In addition to his work in Healthcare IT, he also the chairperson for 
<a href="http://www.osehra.org/">Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance</a>,
an non-profit organization that, amongst other activities, is hosting an upcoming
conference.  The 3rd annual 
<a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/2014-osehra-open-source-ehr-summit-global-collaboration-in-healthcare-it/event-summary-4cca0458427a48a3bd460ab492483f40.aspx">

</a>, which will be taking place September 3-5, 2014 in Washington DC.</p>

<p>For our benevolent recommendation, Shahid suggested listeners may benefit from taking the time to
read 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=LEADERSHIP"> books on leadership</a>
for the insights they provide.  For our self-serving recommendation,
Shahid recommended listeners check out his company <a href="http://www.netspective.com/">Netspective</a>
, if you are working with a company looking for
help getting started building software utilizing next generation technologies.</p>
