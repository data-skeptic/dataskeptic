<h1>Practicing and Communicating Data Science with Jeff Stanton</h1>

<p><a href="http://jsresearch.net/">Jeff Stanton</a> 
joins me in this episode to discuss his book 
<a href="http://101.datascience.community/tag/jeffrey-m-stanton/">An Introduction to Data Science</a>,
and some of the unique challenges and issues faced by someone doing applied data science. 
A challenge to any data scientist is making sure they have a good input data set and apply any
necessary data munging steps before their analysis.  We cover some good advise for how
to approach such problems.</p>

<p>Jeff's book is an accessible, free download that listeners can enjoy independently, or, while 
participating in the linked 
<a href="http://ischool.syr.edu/newsroom/news.aspx?recid=1532">Data Science MOOC</a>.
We talk a bit about the course as well as the growing 
<a href="http://ischools.org/">iSchools</a> movement.</p>

<p>Jeff teaches at Syracuse University which offers a 
<a href="http://ischool.syr.edu/future/cas/datascience.aspx">Certificate of Advanced Studies in Data Science</a>
and a <a href="http://ischool.syr.edu/future/doctoral/dps.aspx">Doctorate of Applied Studies</a>.

<p>During our conversation, Jeff recommended Gerd Gigerenzer's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Calculated-Risks-Know-Numbers-Deceive/dp/0743254236 ">Calculated Risks</a> 
as a good read that listeners may enjoy.</p>

<p>For his benevolent reference, Jeff recommends the the R 
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/">BEST package</a> which stands for "Bayesian 
Estimation Supersedes the T-Test".  If you listened to our recent mini-episode on the 
<a href="http://dataskeptic.com/epnotes/t-test.php">t-test</a>, exploring this package 
would be a great next step in learning how to tackle problems of significance testing.</p>
