<h1>Urban Legends with Karl Mamer</h1>

<p>This week I'm joined by Karl Mamer to discuss the data behind three well known urban legends.  
Did a large blackout in New York and surrounding areas result in a baby boom nine months later?  
Do subliminal messages affect our behavior?  Is placing beer alongside diapers a recipe for 
generating more revenue than these products in separate locations?  Listen as Karl and I explore 
these claims.</p>

<p>Karl is host of <a href="http://www.yrad.com/cs/">The Conspiracy Skeptic</a> Podcast and also
can be heard on the completed <a href="http://www.gokorea.info/">Seoul Survivors</a> about time
spent living in Korea and the great comedy podcast <a href="http://askacanadian.org/">Ask a 
Canadian</a>.

<p>Before getting into the topic, we take a moment to close out a nearly 10 year old innaccuracy
on a webpage (indeed, the internet still has a few pages with errors on them), specifically, a minor tweak to former guest 
<a href="http://www.everything2.com/?node=Lou+Zocchi">Louis Zocchi</a>'s 
<a href="http://www.yrad.com/conspiracyprime/e2.htm">everything2</a> page.
 
<p>As mentioned in the intro, Karl's <a href="http://www.yrad.com/">yrad.com</a> has a wealth of great 
essays well worth looking through.</p>

<p>We first explore the claim that the large 1965 blackout centered around New York City resulted
in a birth boom 9 months later.  Below is the data reported by Richard Udry in his 1970 investigation 
of the black out baby boom claims</p>

<p>While discussing subliminal advertising, we mentioned a few of the claims made by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Bryan_Key">Wilson Bryan Key</a>, notably
the "clam plate orgy":</p>
