		<description><![CDATA[So many new voices here today. Are they all the same person, or have they been sent here by someone? Very unusual to see so many that are not recognized. And so many that are credulous. Not the usual crowd at all. Overall that&#039;s a good thing. Every new person that&#039;s introduced to critical thinking and learns from it is a win.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry but that video doesn&#039;t &#039;prove&#039; that all of the videos are fake. That&#039;s like saying poltergeist is fake because I can pick up a rock and throw it just like a demon can. Your conclusions, quite frankly, have a few leaps in logic.]]></description>

In my experience, most of them have sirens to alert the neighborhood that you forgot to turn it off when you decided to open a window, or decided to take the trash out, or get something from the garage after the wife turned it on for the night.  Very Loud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d target my investigations at the girl&#039;s peers....  see who&#039;s snickering the loudest in school the next day...

As far as bird doo-doo goes..  When I grew up we raised chickens.  The food may have went in dry, but what came out the other end was decidely not.  And we had our share of Canadian geese who nested around our lake.  And pooped all over our lawn.  Constantly.  It was not dry until it had been baking in the sun for a while.  Yuck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I have seen FIRST HAND the dangers of &quot;spirit Boards/Ouija&quot; and other similar spirit divination methods dependent on the spirit moving an object.  Weather it is a subconscious acting out, latent Psychokinesis, or trickery, the danger of harm is real.  Be it stage magic, Pagan Magik or &quot;paranormal challenge&quot;, harm can happen.  There is a psychiatric theory that &quot;Possession&quot; is misbehavior subconsciously permitted by superstitious belief.  So real, delusional, or, peer driven hallucination, &quot;Possession&quot; could happen.]]></description>
