## Dependencies
- [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)
- [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://labix.org/python-dateutil)
- [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations](https://pythonhosted.org/pytz)

See the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.

## Installation from sources
To install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal
dependencies above. Cython can be installed from PyPI:

```sh
pip install cython
```

In the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after
cloning the git repo), execute:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

or for installing in [development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#editable-installs):


```sh
python -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517
```

If you have `make`, you can also use `make develop` to run the same command.

or alternatively

```sh
python setup.py develop
```
