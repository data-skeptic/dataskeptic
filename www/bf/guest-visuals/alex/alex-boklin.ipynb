      "Arguments from design in cosmology stem from the Strong Anthropic Principle, which states that the universe must have such fundamental parame- ters that allow observers to develop within it at some stage in its history.20 A very tempting teleo- logical and theological line of reasoning here would be to conclude that there exists a unique universe specifically designed to generate and sustain ob- servers.21 Indeed, the “fine-tuned universe” might look like a total “cosmic jackpot,” as physicist Paul Davies calls it.22 But does it imply that the winner of this jackpot—i.e., intelligent life—is the product of someone’s or something’s deliberate design? The Anthropic Principle goes against the Copernican principle, which states “we must not assume gratu- itously that we occupy a privileged central position\n",

      "The foundation of a rational theory of coinci- dences through the law of truly large numbers was proposed by mathematicians Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller7 and it relies on two ideas: (1) statistician Ronald Fisher’s idea that “the ‘one chance in a million’ will undoubtedly occur, with no less and no more than its appropriate frequency, however surprised we may be that it should occur to us,”8 and (2) mathematician John Littlewood’s idea that “the adverse chance” for the most remark- able, surprising, and entertaining coincidence would be 106:1 and that we are apt to overestimate improbabilities.9 (106 is 1,000,000, so 106:1 is a mil- lion-to-one.) The law of truly large numbers is for- mulated as follows: “[e]vents rare per person occur with high frequency in the presence of large num- bers of people; therefore, even larger numbers of interactions occur between groups of people and between people and objects.”10 Or, “when enor- mous numbers of events and people and their inter- actions accumulate over time, almost any outrageous event is bound to occur.”11\n",

      "Intelligent design creationists claim that the irre- ducible complexity of some biological systems (e.g., eyes or other multicellular biological systems) negates Darwinian evolution and natural selection, thus proving that these systems are not the product of the laws of nature, chance, and necessity but of design.29 However, as soon as we consider the human brain (which is obviously a much more com- plex biological system than the eye), the claim may seem quite contentious. The brain has never been re- designed from the ground up; rather, the way it has evolved is similar to building an ice cream cone by putting new scoops on top of each other so that the lower, ancient, scoops are left largely unchanged.30 Here again we see the duality of the law of large numbers in action. Individual neurons are horribly slow, leaky, unreliable, and inefficient processors with a very restricted signaling capacity. But the brain on the whole is an agglomeration of 100 billion neurons, massively interconnected by 500 trillion synapses (estimates vary, but the number is huge). Simultaneous processing and subsequent integration of large numbers of neurons allow for sophisticated computation and solving difficult problems: “The brain is a kludge in which an enormous number of interconnected processors can function impressively even when each individual processor is severely lim- ited,” writes David Linden in The Accidental Mind.\n",

      "The second bias is to think that the laws of probability are “filters” that somehow prevent “too long” streaks of unlikely events from happening. Such is the false belief that sampling is a self-cor- recting process (i.e., errors cancel each other out as sampling proceeds): “a deviation from a stable equi- librium produces a force that restores the equilib- rium.”5 This mistake is also known as the gambler’s fallacy, or “The Monte Carlo Fallacy,” named after a famous case. One day in 1913, a roulette wheel landed on black 26 times in a row in a Monte Carlo casino. As this was happening, many casino visitors were betting against black because they thought that the randomness of the roulette wheel would somehow correct the imbalance and cause the wheel to land on red. Naturally, the casino made an enormous profit because roulette wheels—like dice and cards—do not have memories.\n",

We can look for something supernatural, and then these miracles will readily unveil design, conspir- acy, presence of paranormal forces, or what have you.

      "A study by the psychologists Richard Wiseman and Emma Greening19 is the best empirical illustra- tion of how the same logic might work in research practice (although they do not frame it that way). Based on a thorough meta-analysis of previous ESP research (which, as a rule, is conducted in a labora- tory with a very limited number of participants and thus is prone to the mistakes indicated above), the authors devised and conducted the biggest mass par- ticipation ESP experiment to date. The study em- ployed the “mind machines”—machines with specially designed software and built-in random number generators—which participants used in their attempts to guess whether a virtual coin toss would result in a head or a tail. During the 11-month tour around Britain’s leading museums, science fes- tivals, and shopping centers, 27,856 participants contributed 110,959 trials (participants did not have to complete all four trials to be included in the data- base). The researchers compared trials where the outcome was determined both prior to and after participants made their guesses. They also tested whether the participant’s belief in psychic ability, predictions about their upcoming performance, and previous ESP test experience affected their actual ESP scores. None of these significantly differed from chance: in all cases, hits and misses were split almost exactly 50/50—a fact that clearly speaks in defense of coincidental rather than causal nature of ESP phenomena.\n",

      "In response to the criticism the book re- ceived, Drosnin said, “When my critics find a message about the assassination of a prime min- ister encrypted in ‘Moby-Dick’ I’ll believe them.”36 The computer scientist Brendan McKay did just that. Using the text of Moby Dick, which is a famously big book, McKay managed to “fore- tell” the assassinations of Indira Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Leon Trotsky, John F. Kennedy, and Abraham Lincoln.37 But the most “shocking dis- covery” that the mining of Moby Dick applies to Drosnin himself: directly across from his name appears the text “Him to have been killed”! To make things even more interesting, the same piece of text also reveals the method, the place and time, the motive of the murder, and even the names of the murderers.38 Physicist and mathe- matician Dave Thomas applied the “Bible Code” technique to the excerpt from Drosnin’s Bible Code III: Saving the World that was placed online, and found messages about “vain hoax” and “megalo-mania” in it.39 Summing it up, Thomas writes, “The source of the mysterious ‘Bible code’ has been revealed—it’s Homo sapiens.”\n",

      "By considering as many pieces of this picture as possible, we apply the law of large numbers, which guarantees that the sample mean will even- tually get close to the population mean. In other words, the more observations (cases) we have, the more likely it is that we will approach the “real” value. This works with dice and coins: the more you throw them, the closer the mean value will ap- proach the expected value (3.5 for a single die and 0.5 for the coin. The law of large numbers also works with people: when you need to estimate, say, how much an ox at a fair weighs or how many jelly beans there are in a jar, or the correct answer on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? it is better to have a group of individuals rather than one or two. The reason is that some people will miss in one direction, some in another, but all in all, the average answer will very likely be close to the right one.\n",

      "Discussing card-guessing experiments with parapsy- chology cards, Freeman Dyson points at biased sam- pling as one of the methodological issues: according to the law of truly large numbers, “instances” of telepathy are possible, and selective reporting of such instances may mistakenly be taken as “evidence” for ESP abilities. However, only a sufficiently large series of trials would provide a definite answer.17 Consider “premonition.” What is the probability that having thought about a person, you will learn in the next five minutes that this person has died? Physicists Georges Charpak and Henri Broch assumed that one generally knows ten people whose death they learn about over the course of the year and also that one thinks of each of those people a single time over the same one-year period. Knowing that a year has 105,120 “five-minute intervals,” the probability of “having the thought, then learning of their death” pertaining to any of these ten people would be 1/105,120 x 10, or 1 out of 10,512—a tiny chance. However, within the adult U.S. national population (for the year of the publication), the thought-notification connection must occur each year to about 1/10,512 x 250,000,000 or about 23,782 people, or about 65 cases each day. So is there any paranormal component to this “premonition”? No. In fact, by chance it would be a miracle if such an event did not happen!\n",

      "The physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson has called the effect “Littlewood’s Law of Miracles,” and in his formulation the law applies not only to large numbers of people and events, but also single individuals over a long period. If we as- sume, as Littlewood himself did, that a “miracle” is any event that has special significance when it oc- curs with a frequency of one in a million, we can count the probability of such an extraordinary event happening: if we multiply roughly eight hours each day that we are awake by one event per second that we register, we get the total number of events that happen to us on the average—about 30 thousand per day, or about a million per month.12 Now if we switch from individual level to social and apply the law, we can say that on the average, each day mira- cles happen to over 308 people in the United States and to over 7000 people in the world (given about 7 billion people in the world and about 308 million in the United States when this was computed).13\n",

      "The fact that millions of years of evolution pro- duced so much intricacy in living organisms lends itself to the conclusion that it is all designed, but the design is only an illusion. As Richard Dawkins emphasizes, what in hindsight looks like a realiza- tion of some distant goal throughout a long period of time is in reality an incidental consequence of many generations of short-term selection aimed at securing survival or reproductive success—evolu- tion has no long-term goal, and the “watchmaker” (i.e., cumulative natural selection) is blind.32 Or as another evolutionary biologist, the late Stephen Jay Gould suggests, we can look at increasing complex- ity in organisms as a “drunkard’s walk.” Imagine a deadly drunken fellow leaving the bar and having the bar’s wall on one side and the gutter on the other. Randomly staggering back and forth (he can- not go back past the wall), he will eventually end up in the gutter, but this result is by no means a product of his plan.33 The “vaunted progress of life,” Gould concludes, “is really random motion away from simple beginnings, not directed impetus to- ward inherently advantageous complexity.”\n",

      "The age of the universe approaches 14 gigayears (i.e., 14 billion years),25 whereas the radius of the vis- ible universe is about 14.0 gigaparsecs (i.e., about 45.7 billion light-years).26 These numbers are so large that they lie beyond any human comprehension. Our galaxy contains, by recent estimates, 11 billion earth- size planets orbiting sun-like stars (or 40 billion, if we include lukewarm planets orbiting cooler red dwarf stars) in a so-called habitable zone.27 As physi- cists Eric Petigura, Andrew Howard, and Geoffrey Marcy suggest, if we assume that Earth-size planets in habitable zones of Sun-like stars can be encoun- tered with a 22% chance, we can expect the nearest such planet to orbit a star that is less than 12 light- years from Earth. That is usually a star close enough to be seen by the unaided eye.\n",

      "For example, in his study of suicide the sociolo- gist Émile Durkheim proposed that we switch from looking at suicide as a psychological and individual phenomenon in favor of seeing it as a collective phe- nomenon. He also insisted that we study collective phenomena not by generalizing from individual cases but by regarding the former in their collective form through statistical data. Finally, and most im- portant to us, Durkheim claimed that each society has “a collective inclination for the act” and thus es- tablishes a definite quota of voluntary deaths which as long as a society itself does not change, stays the same, even if individuals making it up change from year to year. These suicide rates are similar to the rate of mortality caused by an epidemic: the number of people who will commit suicide is predetermined, but since social forces do not determine one individ- ual rather than another we are unable to predict who exactly that would be.\n",

      "If we want to invoke the law of large numbers, it is important that we keep in mind that it applies only to large numbers. There are two cognitive biases that can hinder us from sorting things out properly. The first is thinking that the law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well, which is not the case. To think that one instance tells us everything about what it represents is to fall for what psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kah- neman call the representation hypothesis—the belief that small samples randomly drawn from a popula- tion will resemble that population in all essential characteristics (i.e., be representative) as well as other small samples drawn from the same popula- tion.3 If you think that Steve is most likely a librar- ian simply because his description (“Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful, but with lit- tle interest in people, or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail”) fits our stereo- type of a librarian (and not a farmer, a salesman, an airline pilot, or a physician), we base our judgment of probability on similarity, or representativeness.
