Recording
---------
Data Skeptic prefers to record interviews via Skype.  If this is not an option for you, we can also use Google Hangout or a land line phone (sorry, no cell phones due to audio quality issues).

If you're new to Skype, [click here](http://www.skype.com/en/) for a tutorial on how to sign up and get started.

### Please enter your recording details below
<input type='radio' id='a' value='skype' checked> Test

<input type='radio' id='a' value='skype'> Google Hangout

<input type='radio' id='a' value='skype'> Land line phone

Sound Quality
-------------
While you don't need an expensive studio microphone to sound good, guests are encouraged to take a few steps to make sure they have the best possible chance of sounding clear and high quality.  This is your chance to sound good!

The most critical requirement is that you have a quiet room with a minimal echo to record in.  Rooms with carpet are generally better.  A relatively inexpensive headset or a decent set of earbugs with mic are usually fine.  If you're concerned about your equipment, consider calling the [Skype Call Testing Service](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA265/how-can-i-test-my-sound-is-working-properly) to hear how you sound.

Consider the possible ambient noise for your intended recording location.  Some warnings signs to avoid:

* The hum of an appliance (e.g. loud refridgerator, window AC unit, ceiling fan)
* The ticking of a clock
* The loud voice of a neighbor separated by a thin wall
* Noise coming through a window

Issues like those listed above reduce the quality of the audio and can make listeners less apt to keep focused on your message.  We want you to sound as good as you possibly can, so please reach out if you have any concerns.

Bio
---
Data Skeptic interviews begin with a short bio read by Kyle.  Click here to listen to an example.  The first draft of your bio is in the box below.  Please use the text field to suggest any corrections or edits you would like.

Special Requests
----------------
Data Skeptic interviews are conversational in nature.  Kyle follows a rough outline but likes to explore interesting diversions and nuances that arise during discussion.  If there are any particular topics or question you would like to make sure get included, please feel free to use the space below to list them out.

Promotions and Plugs
--------------------
Appearing on Data Skeptic is an excellent opportunity to share your work with others and pick up new customers / followers.  Plugs tend to be more effective when Kyle asks about them during the interview, rather than the guest injecting their plug.  Please consider what (if anything) you'd like to promote on the show and write a short description with links in the box below.
