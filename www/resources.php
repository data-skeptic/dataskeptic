<p><a href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/">OpenIntro</a>
provides a great introduction to statistics textbook as a FREE eBook or an at-cost print version.  I got one for under $10 on amazon.  This is a great resource for any listener without a statistics background.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skepdic.com/">Skeptic's Dictionary</a></td> is a 
good reference to skeptical materials and references on many questionable claims.</p>

<p><a href="http://whatstheharm.net/">What's the Harm?</a>
When presented with counter-arguments or empirical falsifications of claims, some people often respond with "What's the Harm?".  This site is a great place to answer that question.</p>

<h2>Other Recommended Podcasts</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.yrad.com/cs/">The Conspiracy Skeptic</a> discusses well known conspiracies from an evidence based perspective.  As they say on talk radio "Long time listener; first time caller" - since I appeared as a guest to discuss The Bible Code in August of 2014.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/">Monster Talk</a> is another personal favorite exploring the skeptical angle on cryptozoological claims, folklore, and monsters in general.</p>

<p><a href="http://datastori.es/">Data Stories</a> is a podcast similar to The Data Skeptic Podcast.  Their focus tends to be a bit more on data visualization.  A great addition for listeners keenly interested in data science.</p>

<p><a href="http://mathmutation.blogspot.com/">Math Mutations</a> explores "weird corners of mathematics that you probably didn't hear in school".</p>

<p><a href="http://probablyscience.libsyn.com/">Probably Science</a> is one of my sources of news.  Hosted by comedians with an interest in science, and featuring frequent celebrity appearances including not only Jana Levin but also Karen Gillan.</p>

<p>... and my appologies to the many great other skeptical and data related podcast I enjoy but could not remember off the top of my head.</p>
