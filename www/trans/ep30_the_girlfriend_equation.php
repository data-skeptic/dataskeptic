<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: The data skeptic podcast
is a legal show featuring conversations about skepticism, critical thinking and
data science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Welcome to another episode
of the data skeptic podcast! I'm here with Linda as always for this
mini-episode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Hello I'm Linda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Linda I'm so excited
because this episode kicks off a four week miniseries we're going to be doing
all on the topic of love and data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Whooh</span>!
I love <span class=SpellE>love</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: I love data and love so do
you want to expand yours maybe and include the other things that through it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Ahaha</span>,
I'm just a normal simple folk <span class=SpellE>haha</span> so I just love <span
class=SpellE>love</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: <span class=SpellE>Alriht</span>.
So yeah I'm excited because there's <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> be another
episode we're <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> do on a similar theme and I have
two great guests lined up. One is the senior data scientist from plenty of fish
which is now my dating website, and the other is an author who wrote a great
book about her experiences trying to both participate and manipulate the average
that work on the show. So we're <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> do four week
series here all about love and we're <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> kick it
off with actually a usual suggestion. Linda you have looked at this right, The
Girlfriend Equation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Kyle sent me an email
where there was a link to a <span class=SpellE>pdf</span> that had some guy in
England or London I believe...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: That's right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: ...try to do some Math and
calculate the probability that he could find a girlfriend by going out in
London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: That's right! And what do
you think of this over-all?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: So I look at it for 5
minutes or so and I never took a statistic class but I thought it was not
accurate. The <span class=GramE>adds</span> were too low.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: I'm <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
ask you why you think they were too low before we get into it let's walk
through the process. This is essentially an &quot;<span class=SpellE>Oi</span>
mush&quot; to the tricky question. Do you know what that is?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Nope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: It's this really cool idea
that Frank Drake put forward to trying to estimate the number of possible
intelligent species that might be out in the rest of the universe trying to
communicate with us so it's actually where our long episode or maybe long
interview at some point so well skip that for now and say that he tried to
follow the same logical process. So for example he starts with N which is the
total population of the UK. Do you think that is a reasonable place to start?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah. But you probably
want to narrow down the population of London because he's just in London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: We'll get there. The First
term he multiplied by is the percentage of what you <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
call it, Great <span class=SpellE>Britainers</span> or UK-<span class=SpellE>ers</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: UK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: No, what's the term for one
from that place?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Alright, citizens in
service to the queen are 51 percent female so he cuts that number down of about
60million to half of that. Then he cuts down that about 13 percent of that
lives in London. So that seems reasonable so far?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, that's fine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: About twenty percent of
that <span class=GramE>are</span> women living in London between the ages of 24
and 34 because by the time he is writing this he was like 30 years old so he
thought that was the reasonable age range. Do you have a problem with that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: That seems suspicious but
let's assume he is correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: That's a reason because I
mean you know there are people in <span class=GramE>a<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>happy</span> relationships that aren't
necessarily closed in age but generally speaking he gave a good range then he
went on to say, &quot;He presumed he would only end up being matched with
someone who has a college degree of which 26 percent of people meet in the
previous criteria are.&quot; How do you feel about that <span class=SpellE>scaler</span>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: 26 percent of people from
the ages oblige</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Of female Londoners between
24 and 34, basically 1 and 4 such women have a college degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Really?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: That seems low</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: It seems low but it must be
right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Especially in UK their
tuition is incredibly cheap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Oh yeah?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Oh Yeah, they just...it's
like a little tax or something each year or semester. I asked them. When I
study abroad in England this is a long time though. That would be surprising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah, that might be a
little low but I'm <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> trust him on that just
pronouncing maybe he got that right even let's say he doubled it 50 percent of
Londoner female 24th to 34th have a college degree. That is just a factor of
two so more or less I'll give now in. His next parameter, he multiplied them by
the percentage of people whom he would be attracted to which he gives them 5
percent or 1 and 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also I mean
you won't narrow him we don't know what he's thinking but that sounds
reasonable, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: No, I think that's too
low.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Too low?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: That is of the people on
his age range</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Age range and college
degree, so also sort of his social status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Not so, he would just
probably find more than 50 percent of women</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: More than 50 come on, that
would mean he has no taste at all. He will just like every other woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I don't think it take that
much</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Oh come on, He have to
chaste you for so long</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Well that's a separate
story</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: I will maybe get to that
one. But anyway if that's just to 5 percent, you'll not <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
date to anyone. So all that gets him down to 10,510 suitable matches for himÉ
he then says, and this is where I think that's where his works is most to
obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ÒÓWell, 5 percent of those
will be attracted back to me, 50 percent will be single and 10 percent will
probably get along with me and me with them which get him down to like 26
possible candidates.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, now that's doubling
too low. He think only 5 percent of those women will be attracted to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: yeah, right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Okay, I don't know what
this person looks like. He is either the average, low average or above average
so 5 percent to me sounds below average. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: You think so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Because I mean, most of
the attraction is personality so if he is saying he's <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
have a good personality to attract someone. What is he saying? It's so odd</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So my main objection to
that is that it's not necessarily his value but that he earlier multiplied by 5
percent of women he would be attracted to and then also tuck on 5 percent would
be attracted back to him which I don't think is totally independent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: So, why would you not
think their independent or you do think not independent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: I do not. I think that
given person A is attracted to Person B that is more likely that person B will
also be attracted to Person A?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I don't knowÉ this is a
great question for the maker of that act where is quite left and right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=SpellE>Kye</span>: <span
class=SpellE>Thinder</span>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Thinder</span>.
How many people? What's the percentage of people whose life left and right on
in each other?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: They'll hear in LA may be
you'd get an engineer who <span class=SpellE>thinder</span> to come along as
well</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I would like to hear what
they have to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: But he also says I object
to this, that only 10 percent of <span class=GramE>all those</span> math put
into matches are those he get along with. That's again on top of only 5 percent
he'll be attracted to and 5 percent will be attracted back to him. So that's
kind a like saying out of a hundred people there's only 2.5 that will be
mutually attracted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&quot;So quick editor's note here
that is actually not right it's weak 2.5 percent so a quarter of a person or 1
&amp; 400.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>And that doesn't seem write to
me. I think that it's not independent. And then, given we already say that we
have two people mutually attracted, why would they will only have 1 and 10
percent of chances eating <span class=GramE>alone<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>with</span> each other. What do you
think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I mean I don't know where
this numbers are coming from. Because whether or not you get a long, some people,
it's just you have to be able to change, be adaptable. I mean that's part of a
relationship and so it seems odd that he goes well to date 10 women and 1 of 10
will stick as if it's he's almost saying it's random well it's not random.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: True. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Because I think if you
went on a date they like each other the more likely to try even if it didn't
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Ah, good point. Maybe, he
figured that in <span class=GramE>this<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>10</span> that even given effort only 1 in 10 will work out </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I mean only 1 in 10 works
out. I think there's something wrong with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Well, I don't think this
guy. He doesn't sound very likeable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So in fairness...I don't
know him personally the author of this is an economist, Peter Backus and also
over all even though we're criticizing his work. I don't think he put this out
there like it was the most rigorous proof. I think it's mostly for fun and you
know, get some journalist to write about his other projects and stuff which is
fine but I think my primary criticism is around how he doesn't consider the
conditional probability that everything is independent but it sounds like you take
most issues with this <span class=SpellE>scaler</span> values issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I don't know what the <span
class=SpellE>scaler</span>, the numbers?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah, the numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, I just don't know
where they're coming from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: In some cases I assume he
went to like senses where he knew 51 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah but the like someone,
like someone back, the chances how work out. I mean what his story? WhatÕs his
statistic?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well, I think we need to
get him in the show but I will agree that given the age group, given the
college degree, given that his attracted to them, all these things put together
is unlikely that it's only 5 percent would be attracted back and 10 percent of
those would get along with him. So I think he's being pessimistic and all this.
What do you think he's odds <span class=GramE>of </span>É</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Of meeting someone?!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: So first of all he has to
get out of his apartment probably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Okay, let's assume he does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: And I guess we assume the
condition was that he asks someone on a date and she will say yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well I don't know I ask you
once and you say, &quot;No&quot; and now we're married so I don't know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah but that was
separate, <span class=SpellE>haha</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Okay</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: So we're saying lots of
the odd that he'll ask someone out and they will say YES</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Aha</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: First of all he's <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> ask someone based he's not just <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
ask anyone so he's already self filtering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: That's true. Maybe
even<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>self filtering strategically
like you know someone I don't know, maybe top ranks, <span class=SpellE>sern</span>,
senior scientist, he might not approach her because he's intimidated with them.
He knows to land a better fish or something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, I mean he's not if
he sees someone married or has a partner, he's probably, &quot;Oh I guess
someone ask her out&quot; so he is already setting up his chances of success by
filtering them and then you know some people are open minded and will not and
will say YES even they don't like you, as in they just don't know you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well, IÕm hungry and broke
so I guess this way can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: No! Don't just agree to
like have a conversation with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Aha...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Coz I mean even you <span
class=GramE>meet</span> them in a bar, in a sidewalk or I don't really know what
I think about you. I think people will be open-minded and say yes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Oh yeah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: For the first date</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span>,
His <span class=GramE>adds</span> are a little better that he lets on in his
paper especially when you're leaving in a densely populated area like London</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Oh yeah, I mean I got in a
subway during rush hour</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So if we <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> want to follow his adds, what do you think will <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> be the likelihood was in you know in a hindsight that
you and I got married</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: At what point?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Ah<span class=GramE>..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Are you assessing the <span
class=GramE>adds</span>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: The vows I guess, I <span
class=SpellE>dont</span> know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span>.
I mean for all in the wedding day, the <span class=GramE>adds</span> are pretty
high that we'll say yes and get married as we planned the wedding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: That's right, well maybe we
should back off and add some colors and we just <span class=SpellE>gonna</span>
talk about our meeting story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Meeting??</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: How we met?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah, what's your
perspective on it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Well, for viewers who
don't know Kyle and I met at work at the company Christmas Party </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Aha</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: And Kyle was not dancing, <span
class=SpellE>haha</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I didn't recognize him so
I thought I would ask him a question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: And we've never met before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: We've never met before and
I was like, &quot;Do you work here?&quot; Because there are people who works there
at the party and people who do not at our place of business. And he was like,
&quot;Ah yeah I work here&quot; and I was like, &quot;Are you lying?&quot; and he
was like, &quot;huh&quot;. Because our workplace has 120 people at that time so
I wasn't sure because you see you could remember 100 faces and I had not
memorize his face so I was like, &quot;I don't know you work there!&quot; So
that's how we met</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: And seven days later
wedding bells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Nope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Would you like to tell the
rest?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: We didn't really start
dating at first, we got to be really good friends, best friends even.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, we're good <span
class=SpellE>friendd</span> for about 8months </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Aha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Or eventually through
8months we became very good friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah, and then what
happened?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Well I think this is your
part to tell, <span class=SpellE>haha</span>, I think it sounds better coming
from you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well, I ask you if you
wanted to go out and you said, &quot;No&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: That's what exactly
happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So the probability is zero
for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Ahaha</span>,
so just a back track Kyle decide one day we're walking away from a bar which
has a lot of coworkers, we went to a happy hours or something after work and
Kyle is really excited and he seems like full of energy and he look at me and
goes.. I can't remember exactly but I think you said to me like, &quot;Will you
go out with me on a date like I think it would be a good idea if we went out on
a date?&quot; And I was so kind of guard. It was like, &quot;What?! No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: And Kyle take off his face
and was like, &quot;Oh Okay&quot; and then you said something that how you
didn't want to look weird and we continued. We able to continue being friends
and then... several months later I developed a crush on him. And I think I have
to climb on at first I said, &quot;When my feelings changed I let you
know&quot; and so. And so I had a work of the nerve to tell him one day at work
that I was like, &quot;Well, maybe we can go on a date or something.&quot; I
can't really remember my words maybe you can remember better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: I just remember the
unprofessional nature of it. Because when I do it, it wasn't on company time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: <span class=SpellE>Haha</span>.
Yes, so then I was just like, &quot;Yeah maybe we should go on a date&quot;.
And we did, after that Kyle was still willing to go on a date with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So thank goodness to that
potion #9 I slept to the one that...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Well I always tell people
it's not love at first sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda &amp; Kyle: <span
class=SpellE>Ahahhaah</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Or even second, third, fourth,
fifth or how many times we hang out off. You do not know who you're <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> marry sometimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: So maybe our associate through
discussion Peter Backus who wrote &quot;The Girlfriend Equation&quot; will or
perhaps has because it was an older paper but experienced similar fortunate
circumstance for himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, and maybe he already
knew the person that he was <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> marry later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Ah, so he's strategically
turned down all these <span class=SpellE>Londonites</span> females?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Yeah, and when you'll <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> talk to him get a feel of what he's personality was,
like who end up you marrying, are you married now and do you think your
statistics are accurate?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Yeah, maybe we'll get him
into the show and we'll see what happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Because if he's married
now, I don't think his <span class=GramE>adds</span> were right. <span
class=SpellE>Haha</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well that's an interesting
discussion that essentially the confirmation bias that will be the topic for
another day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: I would like to hear this
guy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Kyle: Well, thanks for joining me
Linda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Linda: Thank you for joining me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&lt;END&gt;</p>
