<p>Weclome future Data Skeptic guest!  We are excited to have you coming on the show.</p>

<p>Data Skeptic typically records via Skype, which gives reasonably good call quality if you have
a decent internet connection.  Kyle will record both sides of the conversation on his end; all you
need to do is accept the Skype call.</p>

<p>Below are a few bullet points of advice for how you can help achieve the best audio quality.  
The episodes where my guests can be heard most clearly get noticably more downloads and social 
media buzz, so please let me know if I can help you achieve the best results.</p>  

<h2>Some steps for achieving good audio quality</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be in a quiet, issolated room
<li>Find a room that doesn't have an obvious echo.  Many conference rooms do.
<li>Check if any machine noise (e.g. refrigerator compressor, computer fan, electronics buzz) could distract from your voice.
<li>Consider if there might be road / construction noise outside during recording that could leak in through a window.
<li>If you have access to a "gaming headset", these often have very good audio quality, but even earbugs with a microphone can sound ok.  Your computer's built in microphone will almost certainly sound bad.
<li>Try the "Skype Call Testing Service" in advance to see how you sound.
</ul>
