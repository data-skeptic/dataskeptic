<p>Hello internet citizen,</p>

<p>Thanks for writing to me, and apologies for providing a templated response.  Both my activities on Data Skeptic and my position at DataScience, Inc. have made me a sought after person.  Unfortunately, I can no longer make personal replies to all emails.  I wish I could reserve every Thursday for correspondence the way Martin Gardner did, but alas, this is not an option for me at this time.</p>

<p>It saddens me deeply that I can no longer personally engage with everyone who takes an interest, but I've got a full time job, a popular podcast, a marriage, and a number of other activities I need to balance.  This spreads my time thin and forces me to make tough prioritization decisions.  Them's the breaks.  This FAQ has advice on how to best connect, or skip that step if I can help you with repeatable advice.</p>

<p>I tend to get asked the same question many times, so I've prepared some standard answers here to share.  Though impersonal, I hope this information is helpful to you.  For what it's worth, I only share this link with people who write me, so you can feel a little special that you unlocked this "secret" page.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you are really seeking a personalized reply, try writing me in a public forum such as the Data Skeptic Facebook page or in the comments on dataskeptic.com.  I'm much more likely to make time for you if my response can benefit others as well.</p>

<h1>How do I become a data scientist?</h1>
<p>At present, data science is a discipline people find their way into from many starting points.  It's also a broad umbrella term which can describe two professionals having little or nothing in common.</p>

<p>Become a data scientist because you're passionate about it, and not for any other reason whatsoever.  Most data scientists are deeply passionate about the field.  We spend our off hours reading papers, doing side projects, and keeping up.  If that's a chore for you, you'll be left behind by your peers.</p>

<p>My best advice is to find people you admire and would like to emulate.  Perhaps that's me, but there's many other outstanding people to emulate, perhaps better than me.  Find the person with the position you want and figure out how they got there.  Duplicate their skillset.  Then ask how you can go further than them.</p>

<p>Beef up on statistics and machine learning.  Get the free OpenIntro Statistics book and read it cover to cover.  Master logistic regression (it's final chapter).  Play with the Mario Kart dataset they provide for a while, then find your own dataset and explore, explore, explore.</p>

<p>Once you've finished OpenIntro, take on Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's "The Elements of Statistical Learning".  It's meaty.  You'll find it intimidating at first.  Eventually, you'll clear the learning curve and be on your way.</p>

<p>Many people speak positively of Ng's course.  I've never taken it, but I expect it's excellent.  I tutor at thinkful.com.  I may not be able to tutor you, but their one on one mentoring is a great place to start if you can afford it.</p>

<p>You're also going to need to be able to implement things.  There's a plethora of programming languages to choose from.  Pick one.  I recommend Python.  Learn enough engineering to take your ideas and what you learn about data science from the whiteboard to proof of concept.</p>

<p>Data science is a broad area.  You won't be able to learn it all.  I certainly haven't.  Find the areas that you're best suited to and most interested in and never stop pushing the limits of your knowledge about them.</p>

<p>Share your work as you go and solicit feedback.  Get a github account going and consider starting a blog.  Find a practical side project and voraciously work on it.  Spend some time promoting that project and getting feedback on it.</p>

<p>Do you have some other domain expertise?  Are you pivoting into data science?  Do you have a bachelor's or minor in some other interesting topic?  It's unlikely you'll become the world's most well known data scientist, but you could easily become the world's most well known data scientist working on _____.  Combine this field with another and you could likely be an unstoppable force of innovation and change.</p>

<p>Start networking.  The biggest city near you almost certainly has a data science related meetup.  Go to lectures, find the community online and offline, and engage with it.</p>

<p>On your journey, I expect you'll be eager to move forward quickly.  You'll encounter certain topics and often feel like you've absorbed them or get the gist, and skim past it.  If you travel the world, and only hit tourist spots, staying for 1-2 days in every city, you'll never see anything.  To truly understand a city, you must live there.  You can't live everywhere, so plan your itinerary well and make sure to get intimately familiar with the topics of interest to you.  If something seems simple and easy to skim, you're probably missing something deeper.</p>

<h1>Will you hire me?</h1>
<p>Maybe.  Statistically speaking, probably not.  My needs to hire new collaborators waxes and wanes.  Further, my need to hire generalists, specific experts, and entry level people varies.  I only hire the best of the best, who by definition, can easily find jobs elsewhere.  Thus, I either have immediate hire opportunities, or none at all.</p>

<p>Start by making your resume and online profile a stellar example of who you are and let that speak for itself.  If I consider you, I'm going to do it once, so put your best foot forward.  The best way to get my attention is to follow the standard paths I've created: find an active job description, make sure you are qualified for it, and submit your application.  I don't like when people try to cheat, cut corners, or ask for special treatment.   If you fail to get an acknowledgement a short while after submitting, it's okay to follow up.  But the number one reason I don't hire someone is because the timing simply isn't right.</p>

<p>Most of all, be honest in how you portray yourself.  The quickest way to get disqualified is to list skills you don't actually have.  A big part of collaboration for me is honesty, trust, and ingenuity.  I can help you develop skills you don't have, but I have to know where we're starting from.</p>

<p>There are more qualified people in the world than positions I need to fill, so realize that the odds begin against you, even if you are amazing.  With that in mind, refer to the next question.</p>

<h1>Will you help me find a job?</h1>
<p>It would be my pleasure to help if I can, and I truly mean that.  I've placed a number of people into good positions over the last few years, and I have a decent network.  That said, I am not a recruiter and I get no compensation for my assistance.  Benevolently helping others connect is important, but low on my priority list.  For this reason, I need to restrict the people I can help to those that are looking to work in the Los Angeles area.</p>

<p>If you'd like my help, do your homework first.  Search online and apply for jobs.  When you reach out, make it clear to me that you've made sufficient effort to find a position, rather than just throwing your resume over the fence and hoping I'll do your work for you.  If you truly appear to be spinning your wheels, I'll do what I can to help.</p>

<h1>Can I sponsor the Data Skeptic podcast?</h1>
<p>At this time I do not accept any form of sponsorship for Data Skeptic.</p>

<p>The cost of this venture (more or less) amount to a medium expensive hobby, and thus, I'm comfortable absorbing all the cost.  This allows me to avoid any possible conflict of interest and most importantly, frees me from the very costly administrative time investment handling all the details so that I can focus on the content itself.</p>

<p>I have big plans for what Data Skeptic will become in the future, and I will need funding at some point.  I prefer that be through listener subscriptions, but if you'd like to be on my "waiting list" for sponsorship, send me an email.</p>

<h1>Can I be on the Data Skeptic podcast?</h1>
<p>I know people mean well when I get asked this.  On one hand, I am flattered when someone sees Data Skeptic as an important forum and wants to share their work via my channel.  However, the vast majority of these requests and thinly veiled self-promotions, rather than genuinely unique or interesting perspectives, which is what I choose to share on Data Skeptic.</p>

<p>I believe I've achieved a high quality of content for the show by curating the best guests and topics.  I believe sponsored content and interviews which mostly promote a company, product, or service degrade this, and thus, I'm not open to it. Data Skeptic is not, nor will it ever be a pay-to-play program.</p>

<p>Lastly, on a more personal side, I'm always a bit put off by requests like this.  They feel a bit like someone inviting themself over to dinner.  If you're going to ask to be on the show, DO NOT make this request in a public forum.  I don't appreciate being put in a position where I'm forced to be "the bad guy".  Write me a <u>private</u> email with your request.</p>

<p>In this email, make a clear pitch about what skill or insight the listener will learn from your appearance.  I will immediately reject "they will learn how to use my company's tool or service".  I might accept "they will learn how my company's tool was used to solve this interesting problem in an open source way".</p>

<p>Beginning in 2015, I started a new process for the show.  In the last week of the year, I sit down and plot out everything I hope to do in the following year.  This includes picking all mini-episode topics for the year, selecting all specials and outlining them, and making a list of guests I wish to have.  Thus, it's very likely I've scheduled the show so far into the future, that I'm not open to new guests.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you want to ask "can I be on the show?", you're probably asking me the wrong question.  Try asking the next question, and seeing where it goes.</p>

<h1>Will you critique my work?</h1>
<p>I'll do my best to try.  First, make sure your work relates to the topics I cover on Data Skeptic.  Second, write me an email with a brief description of your work and what open questions you have.  Third, please be patient.</p>

<p>I'm more likely to review your work if it's concise.  Odds are, I don't have time to read your thesis, but would gladly like to try reading a conference paper you've written.  Sending me a link to your work on arXiv is the best way to make that happen.  If you're work is a project that's available on the web, that's great to.  I hope to have the time to take a look and write you an email with my thoughts.</p>

<p>When sending me a project on the web, realize I'm only going to have time to review it once.  Please ensure it's in the state you want it to be for me to look at it.  I'm not your QA team.  I'm a Chrome user who is very trigger happy to close tabs on broken pages.</p>

<p>Lastly, as mentioned in previous questions, I've very amenable to people requesting my commentary on their work.  When I see something special, I'll definitely take notice.  So if you'd like to be a Data Skeptic guest, or you're hoping to find a full time position working with me in Los Angeles, your best bet is to start here.  If you're work is truly exceptional, I'll take notice, and something more than a critique will likely follow.</p>
