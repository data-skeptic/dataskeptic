<p>Hello listener/visitor/reader,</p>

<p>I appreciate your interest in getting into contact with Data Skeptic.  When I started the podcast in 2014, I was thrilled to start getting
feedback and questions from fans.  I was able to give a lot of personalized advice about career, research, and specific problems.  Although
time consuming, I truly enjoyed these correspondences.</p>

<p>Since starting Data Skeptic, the reach of the organization has grown by a few orders of magnitude.  I find myself no longer having the availability
to respond to every personal request I get via email or direct/private message.  If you're inclined to share feedback via these channels, your input
is greatly appreciated, but I can no longer commit to responding.</p>

<p>With finite time to interact directly with listeners, I've had to make choices about optimizing my time.  If you have a question, comment, or
correction on a specific show, please visit the episode specific page and leave a comment at the bottom in the Disqus comment area.  This might allow
for other visitors to respond as well.  If you're looking to get a personal response directly from me, please reach out via a public channel such
as Twitter 
(<a href="https://twitter.com/dataskeptic">@dataskeptic</a>)
or on the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dataskeptic">Data Skeptic Facebook page</a>.
When questions are asked in public forums, both the asker as well as others, can benefit from the reply.  Thus, in the interest of time, I find
myself prioritizing publically asked questions for response.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>

</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Kyle Polich</p>
