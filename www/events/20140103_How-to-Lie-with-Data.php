<h1>How to Lie with Data</h1>

<p>Linhda and I will be attending SkeptiCamp Monterey January 3rd 2015, and I'll be one of the
presenters as well.</p>

<p>I'll be giving a short talk covering a few fun examples of techniques that are used which appear to 
be data driven but actually misrepresent the underlying thesis. The talk will include some real world 
examples and some advice for how to be skeptical of dodgy data driven arguments.</p>

<p>Please check back here as the date gets closer for a teaser of some of the content.</p>
