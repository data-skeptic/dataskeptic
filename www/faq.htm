<h2>How do I set up a config file for the batch uploader?</h2>
<a name="config-file"/>
<p>The software expects that you have a file called "openhouse.config" in the same directory as the uploader file.  The file should contain your
personal account credentials (user and password), as well as the baseurl so you can specify which environment you are uploading to.  Below is
