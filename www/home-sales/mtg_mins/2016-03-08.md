# 2016-02-23 Minutes

To start this meeting, Kyle discussed organizing four committees:

1. API committee - create an open source API and stand it up
2. Persistence committee - a group that figures out where the API stores and retrieves data from
3. API producers - people interested in writing services that push data they get from crawls (edited)
4. API consumers - people building interactive apps consuming the API's data

The suggestion was made that API and Persistence committee be merged.  Kyle comes around to seeing it
the same way so long as we can have a clean data access layer.  He expressed an interest in exploring
creating some sort of "TorrentDB" in the future, leveraging peer to peer storage.
