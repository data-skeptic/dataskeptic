We're officially pushing data to the API, albeit from humble beginnings.  For details on how you too could push data, check out the [api-connector repository](https://github.com/data-skeptic/api-connector).

If you're a bit more technically savvy, the [readthedocs](http://data-skeptic-home-data-api.readthedocs.org/en/develop/) page might be useful for you.

Kyle started pushing data from foresalebyowner.com which you can view [here](http://dataskeptic.com/blog/b010_pushing-data-to-home-sales-api.php)

## Next Steps

Looking for volunteers to create other data pushing agents.  Also looking for volunteers to work on our [API issues](https://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues)
