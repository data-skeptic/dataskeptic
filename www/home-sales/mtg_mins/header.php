Below are the meeting minutes for the Data Skeptic Home Sales project.  I've decided not to include
anyone's names, instead referring to people as "attendees" or something like that.  Although anyone
can join the Slack channel, and therefore see the full conversation, I didn't explicitly get everyone's
permission to mention them by name, so I thought this was a middle ground.  If any mentioned attendees
want their name included here, I'm happy to edit.  I would also LOVE to have someone take the minutes
for me, since it's not my specialty.  If there are any volunteers, please let me know!
