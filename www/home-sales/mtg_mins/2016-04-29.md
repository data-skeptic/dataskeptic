# Agenda

## Finding project / task for new volunteer
Discussed the [Onboarding page](http://dataskeptic.com/home-sales/onboarding.php) and routed some attendees.

## API / App updates
Good progress being made.  Focus on app this week.  0.2 tagged issues going out soon.  Conflict resolution page 80% done.

## App Deployment
S3 buckets will be set up for production and dev environments with standard DNS.

# Discussion
Confirmed the use case for appraisals can be handled as new record type.

# Next Steps
Mid-may will likely be a good time to ramp up API uploads.

S3 buckets will be set up and DNS will be set to home-app.dataskeptic.com and home-app-dev (buckets should be 300 destination)

Switch meeting notes to Google Docs for shared easy access.
