This week we are setting three goals for next week.

## Goal 1: Add flagging to API

Add in a [flagging option](https://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues/8) should be added to the API to enable duplicate flagging, to clean up the problem we're seeing of data duplication.  A simple demo script will also flag exact match duplicates as a start to a deduping agent, which will need to be smarter and do merges eventually.

## Goal 2: LA County Integration

The [LA County Tax Assessor](http://maps.assessor.lacounty.gov/GVH_2_2/Index.html?configBase=http://maps.assessor.lacounty.gov/Geocortex/Essentials/REST/sites/PAIS/viewers/PAIS_hv/virtualdirectory/Resources/Config/Default) has a website with an unofficial API that should pull in some local Los Angeles data.  We should put a good effort into consuming this data and pushing it to our API.

## Goal 3: Basic Webapp

We're going to use basic javascript and jQuery to build our first consumer app of the API which retrieves listings for a given zipcode and displays them as a table.  It was proposed we explore using [https://github.com/github/fetch].
