Data Skeptic is launching a new community project to gather, process, and explore home purchasing data.
If you'd like to participate, please join our Slack channel by submitting your email via the form at the bottom.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data about active and historic home sales in the United States is difficult if not impossible to access.  It is unnecessarily obfuscated, harming both buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>A variety of companies in the vein of Trulia and Zillow have helped consumers, but they don't offer full featured APIs, making it impossible for a data scientist to access a sufficient dataset to inform their decisions.</li>
<li>In the spirit expressed by true hackers, this information should be free.</li>
<li>An open community driven project should exist to liberate this data and provide tools for accessing new and current data.</li>
<li>Data Skeptic shall launch such a project.</li>
</ul>
