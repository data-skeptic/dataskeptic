OpenHouse is a community project with the objective of gathering, processing, and exploring home purchasing data.
Today, this data is not readily accessible to the general public on a granular and longitudinal basis, which would
be required to do interesting analysis.  This project seeks to liberate historical and current data on home sales
to enable consumers to make smarter, better informed decisions, and to provide a rich, robust dataset for data
scientists and data visualization people to do interesting work.</p>

<p>OpenHouse now has it's own website, please visit us there to learn more:</p>
