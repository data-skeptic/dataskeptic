<h1>Volunteer Onboarding</h1>

<p>Hi.  Thanks for your interest in helping with the Data Skeptic Home Sales project!</p>

<p>We intend for there to be opportunities for anyone interested in getting involved to do so regardless of their available time or technical background.
Students and experts alike can contribute.<p>

<p>The first step is to drop by our Slack channel and introduce yourself!  Tell us about who you are and what your interest in the project is.
As a second step, figure out which section below best describes the way you'd like to contribute.</p>

<h2>Non-technical Contributions</h2>
<p>A Trello board for non-technical contributions will be added shortly.</p>

<h2>Data Pusher</h2>
<p>Do you know of a data source that covers an area we current don't have data for?  Are you willing to help get that data streamed
into our system?  Great!  To get started, visit the <a href="http://github.com/data-skeptic/data-source-notes">Data Source Notes</a> repository
which will explain the best procedure for contributing in this way.</p>

<h2>Bug Finder / QA</h2>
<p>Have you found a problem in one of our systems or are you interesting in hunting for problems?  We use Github Issues to track bugs.  Please
consider filing one for us.  For example, our API codebase can be found here:
<a href="http://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues">http://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues</a>.</p>

<h2>API Extender</h2>
<p>Do you have experience in Django Framework for Python?  Maybe you can help fix a bug or implement a requested feature in our API.
Check out the <a href="http://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues">Issues page</a> and see if there's anything you'd like to tackle.</p>

<h2>API Consumer</h2>
<p>Right now we're light on data.  It's ok, we're in the first phases of the project.  In time, we'll be rich in data.  At that point, we'll
be eager to facilitate lots of machine learning, forecasting, and data visualization projects.</p>
